## Project Summary

Below is the code and notes for the Wind River Sauger Parentage Analysis bioinformatics workflow. This began on 10/25/24 with file transfers and establishment of the Sauger Parentage github repository, followed by unzipping files (10/29/24) and parsing (11/01/24).

## Workflow Outline

* Demultiplex

* Split .fastq

* Alignment

* Variant Calling

* Filtering

* Entropy

## Demultiplex

### Unzip raw .fastq's

Requires an ssh key for your hpc server to connect it with the repository. Then you'll git clone that repository to your server's account. Unzip using this script from JPJ.

```{bash}
sbatch slurm_zip.sh
```

### Count raw reads

See code below. Establish an allocated interactive job, then you're checking for n raw reads using the @ symbols that separate reads in the .fastq file structure.

```{bash}
salloc --account=ysctrout --time=3:00:00
grep -c "^@" 1SaugEvens.fastq
   # 1,111,224,597
grep -c "^@" 1SaugOdds.fastq
   # 1,156,307,046
```

### Parsing

Obtained the following slurm script from JPJ. Must provide correct file paths to the script and to the raw data files (See lines 17 and 18). This also happens in the interactive job! Don't run jobs like this on the login node!

```{bash}
sbatch slurm_parse.sh
```
